            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I like to read, hangout with my friends, learn about designing and coding, my favourite color is black, I like to play video games, i'm a really ambitious person, I have big goals to achieve, such as become financially free, having my dream car, and day trade my favourite stock market.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal at the moment is to achieve my <em>dream body</em> by the end of April 25<sup> th</sup>, so I have to work out hard and consistent, eat well, which will play a big factor, I also want to graduate from this program, not only because it's a diploma, but the fact that I like this program and really interested about it, and I can't wait to learn even more each time.
            </p>
